# Approaches to Teaching R :woman_teacher:
In this repo, you'll find the material for a webinar I gave on Approaches to Teaching R to the NHS-R community. 

## What online platforms would I recommend for teaching R?
- **[RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/)** - great online platform for teaching
- **[RPubs](https://rpubs.com/)** - great free platform for sharing R Markdown files

## In terms of content and teaching material, where should you start?
- **Blogs/Tutorials** - ideas and resources for where you can get started
- **Websites** - a great tool for sharing resources (but a bit more advanced and time-consuming)

## Materials
- Powerpoint slides 
- .Rmd file on "How to Publish to Rpubs"
